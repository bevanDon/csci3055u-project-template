## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```kotlin
fun printval(val1: String, val2: String) {
    val x = parseInt(val1)
    val y = parseInt(val2)

  
    if (x != null && y != null) {
        
        println(x * y)
    }
    else {
        println("either '$arg1' or '$arg2' is not a number")
    }    
}
```
